## Key Files Modified/Created

### ESP32
- `apps/wearable/wearable.ino` - BLE server implementation

### Android
- `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added Bluetooth permissions
- `app/src/main/java/com/epsilon/app/ui/bluetooth/BluetoothScreen.kt` - NEW: BLE scanner UI
- `app/src/main/java/com/epsilon/app/utils/PermissionUtils.kt` - NEW: Permission helper
- `app/src/main/java/com/epsilon/app/navigation/AppNavigation.kt` - Added Bluetooth route
- `app/src/main/java/com/epsilon/app/ui/home/HomeScreen.kt` - Added Bluetooth button

## Permissions Required

Android automatically requests:
- âœ… BLUETOOTH_SCAN (Android 12+)
- âœ… BLUETOOTH_CONNECT (Android 12+)
- âœ… ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
- âœ… BLUETOOTH (Android 11 and below)
- âœ… BLUETOOTH_ADMIN (Android 11 and below)

```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] ESP32 uploaded successfully
- [ ] Serial Monitor shows "Waiting for a client..."
- [ ] Android app installed
- [ ] Bluetooth permissions granted
- [ ] ESP32 appears in scan results
- [ ] Connection successful
- [ ] Status messages received

## Common Issues & Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| ESP32 not found | â€¢ Check ESP32 is powered on<br>â€¢ Verify Serial Monitor shows "Waiting..."<br>â€¢ Move phone closer to ESP32 |
| Permission denied | â€¢ Go to Settings > Apps > FallBag<br>â€¢ Grant all Bluetooth permissions<br>â€¢ Restart app |
| Won't connect | â€¢ Reset ESP32 (press RESET button)<br>â€¢ Stop and restart scan<br>â€¢ Clear app data |
| Upload failed | â€¢ Hold BOOT button during upload<br>â€¢ Check USB cable<br>â€¢ Verify correct board selected |

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build Android app
cd apps/android
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on device
./gradlew installDebug

# Build and install
./gradlew installDebug
```

## What Happens After Connection

1. ESP32 sends "Status: OK" every second
2. Android displays received messages
3. Connection status shown in UI
4. Can disconnect with "Disconnect" button

## Next: Add Your Sensors

In `wearable.ino`, replace:
```cpp
String sensorData = "Status: OK";
```

With your sensor data:
```cpp
String sensorData = "X:" + String(x) + ",Y:" + String(y) + ",Z:" + String(z);
```

Then parse it in Android's `onCharacteristicChanged()` callback!
