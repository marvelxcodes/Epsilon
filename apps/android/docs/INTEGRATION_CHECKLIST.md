## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests (Before Deployment)

- [ ] **Test SupabaseManager Connection**
  ```kotlin
  // Verify credentials are correct
  // Check logcat for "Successfully subscribed to falls channel"
  ```

- [ ] **Test EmergencyContactManager**
  ```kotlin
  val manager = EmergencyContactManager(context)
  manager.saveEmergencyContact("+1234567890", "Test Contact")
  assert(manager.hasEmergencyContact())
  assert(manager.getEmergencyContact() == "+1234567890")
  ```

- [ ] **Test EmergencyCallManager Permissions**
  ```kotlin
  val manager = EmergencyCallManager(context)
  assert(manager.hasPhoneCapability())
  // Note: hasCallPermission() requires user to grant
  ```

- [ ] **Test Service Lifecycle**
  ```kotlin
  FallDetectionService.startService(context)
  // Check notification appears
  FallDetectionService.stopService(context)
  // Check notification disappears
  ```

### Integration Tests

- [ ] **Login Flow ‚Üí Service Start**
  1. Launch app (not logged in)
  2. Login with valid credentials
  3. Verify service starts automatically
  4. Check for "Fall Detection Active" notification

- [ ] **Emergency Contact Setup Flow**
  1. Navigate to Emergency Contact screen
  2. Grant CALL_PHONE permission
  3. Enter phone number and name
  4. Save contact
  5. Verify success message
  6. Verify saved in SharedPreferences

- [ ] **Fall Detection Flow (End-to-End)**
  1. Ensure service is running
  2. Insert test fall in Supabase
  3. Verify app receives Realtime event
  4. Verify emergency call is placed
  5. Check notification updates

- [ ] **Background Operation**
  1. Start service
  2. Lock phone screen
  3. Insert test fall
  4. Verify call still placed
  
- [ ] **App Closure Survival**
  1. Start service
  2. Close app from recent apps
  3. Check service still running (notification)
  4. Insert test fall
  5. Verify call still placed

- [ ] **Boot Persistence**
  1. Configure emergency contact
  2. Ensure user is logged in
  3. Reboot device
  4. Check service auto-starts (notification)

### Permission Tests

- [ ] **CALL_PHONE Permission**
  - Grant during setup
  - Verify calls can be placed
  - Test denial scenario

- [ ] **POST_NOTIFICATIONS (Android 13+)**
  - Request on Android 13+
  - Verify notification appears

- [ ] **FOREGROUND_SERVICE**
  - Auto-granted (normal permission)
  - Verify service runs in foreground

## üîç Verification Commands

### Check Service Running
```bash
adb shell dumpsys activity services | grep FallDetectionService
```

### Check Permissions
```bash
adb shell dumpsys package com.epsilon.app | grep permission
```

### Monitor Logs
```bash
# All fall detection logs
adb logcat | grep -E "FallDetection|SupabaseManager|EmergencyCall"

# Service only
adb logcat | grep FallDetectionService

# Realtime only
adb logcat | grep SupabaseManager

# Call manager only
adb logcat | grep EmergencyCallManager
```

### Test Fall Insertion (Manual)
```bash
# Using curl (replace values)
curl -X POST 'https://your-project.supabase.co/rest/v1/falls' \
  -H "apikey: your-anon-key" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-anon-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id":"your-user-id","is_fall":true}'
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Service Not Starting

**Symptoms:**
- No "Fall Detection Active" notification
- Logcat shows no FallDetectionService messages

**Solutions:**
1. Check user is logged in
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep "userId"
   ```
2. Verify permissions in AndroidManifest.xml
3. Check for exceptions in logcat
4. Try manual start:
   ```kotlin
   FallDetectionService.startService(context)
   ```

### Issue: Calls Not Placing

**Symptoms:**
- Fall detected but no call placed
- Error in logcat: "CALL_PHONE permission not granted"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify CALL_PHONE permission granted
2. Check emergency contact is configured
3. Verify device has telephony capability
4. Check logcat for specific error

### Issue: Realtime Not Connecting

**Symptoms:**
- Service running but no events received
- Logcat: "Error subscribing to falls"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Supabase credentials correct
2. Check network connectivity
3. Verify Realtime enabled for table
4. Check RLS policies allow access
5. Test with manual SQL insert

### Issue: Service Stops After Time

**Symptoms:**
- Service starts but stops after minutes/hours
- No notification after time

**Solutions:**
1. Disable battery optimization
2. Check manufacturer-specific settings
3. Verify START_STICKY is working
4. Check device battery saver mode
