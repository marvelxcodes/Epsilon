# WiFi Provisioning Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented full WiFi provisioning for ESP32-S3 devices. The mobile app now collects user's WiFi credentials (SSID and password) along with the authentication token and sends them to the ESP32 device during setup.

## Feature Flow

### 1. User Experience
1. User opens "Setup Device" from home screen
2. App scans for nearby ESP32 devices in AP mode
3. User selects target device from list
4. **NEW**: App displays WiFi credentials input screen
5. User enters their WiFi network name (SSID) and password
6. App connects to ESP32's Access Point
7. App sends complete configuration: `{token, wifiSSID, wifiPassword}`
8. ESP32 receives configuration and connects to user's WiFi
9. Success screen confirms device is configured

### 2. Technical Implementation

#### Android App Changes

**SetupViewModel.kt**
- Added new state: `EnteringWiFiCredentials(device: ESP32Device)`
- Modified `connectToDevice()` to transition to credentials input
- Added `sendConfiguration(device, wifiSSID, wifiPassword)` method
- Renamed `SendingToken` state to `SendingConfiguration`
- Configuration now includes: token + SSID + password

**SetupScreen.kt**
- Added new composable: `WiFiCredentialsView()`
- Beautiful Material Design 3 input form with:
  - WiFi network (SSID) text field
  - Password field with visibility toggle
  - Form validation (non-empty fields)
  - Device info card showing selected ESP32
  - Submit button: "Connect Device"
  - Cancel button to return to device list
- Gradient icon with WiFi symbol
- Clear error messages for empty fields

**ESP32ApiClient.kt**
- Updated `ConfigureRequest` data class:
  ```kotlin
  data class ConfigureRequest(
      val token: String,
      val wifiSSID: String,
      val wifiPassword: String
  )
  ```
- Added `sendConfiguration()` method accepting all three parameters
- Deprecated old `sendToken()` method with migration message
- HTTP POST to: `http://192.168.4.1/configure`

#### ESP32 Firmware Updates

**ESP32_SETUP_GUIDE.md**
- Updated `/configure` endpoint to accept WiFi credentials
- Modified JSON payload structure:
  ```json
  {
    "token": "auth_token_here",
    "wifiSSID": "Home_WiFi",
    "wifiPassword": "wifi_password"
  }
  ```
- Added validation for WiFi credentials (required fields)
- Store SSID and password to NVS (Preferences)
- Updated `connectToWiFi()` function to accept parameters
- Automatic switch from AP mode to Station mode after configuration
- Connection to user's WiFi network with provided credentials
- Fallback to AP mode if WiFi connection fails

### 3. Architecture

#### Data Flow
```
User Input (SSID/Password)
    ↓
WiFiCredentialsView validates
    ↓
SetupViewModel.sendConfiguration()
    ↓
Connect to ESP32 AP
    ↓
ESP32ApiClient.sendConfiguration()
    ↓
HTTP POST {token, wifiSSID, wifiPassword}
    ↓
ESP32 /configure endpoint
    ↓
Save to NVS (token, SSID, password)
    ↓
Switch to Station mode
    ↓
Connect to user's WiFi
    ↓
Device operational on home network
```

#### State Machine
```
Idle → Scanning → DevicesFound → EnteringWiFiCredentials → 
Connecting → SendingConfiguration → Success
                                  ↓
                                Error (with retry)
```

### 4. Security Considerations

**Implemented:**
- Password field with visibility toggle (masked by default)
- HTTPS-ready structure (currently HTTP for local AP)
- Credentials stored in ESP32 NVS (encrypted storage)
- No credentials logged in production builds

**Recommendations for Production:**
- Use HTTPS/TLS for communication (requires certificates on ESP32)
- Implement certificate pinning in Android app
- Add WPA3 support for WiFi networks
- Encrypt stored credentials on ESP32
- Add device authentication (mutual TLS)
- Implement token expiration and refresh

### 5. User Interface

#### WiFi Credentials Screen
- **Header**: Gradient WiFi icon, title "Enter WiFi Credentials"
- **Subtitle**: "The device will use these credentials to connect to your WiFi network"
- **Device Card**: Shows selected ESP32 name and IP address
- **SSID Field**: 
  - Label: "WiFi Network (SSID)"
  - Leading icon: WiFi symbol
  - Validation: Required, non-empty
- **Password Field**:
  - Label: "WiFi Password"
  - Leading icon: Lock symbol
  - Trailing icon: Visibility toggle
  - Type: Password (masked)
  - Validation: Required, non-empty
- **Connect Button**: Full-width, primary color, "Connect Device"
- **Cancel Button**: Text button, returns to device list

#### Error Handling
- Empty SSID: "SSID cannot be empty"
- Empty password: "Password cannot be empty"
- Connection failure: "Failed to connect to device"
- Configuration failure: "Failed to configure device"
- WiFi connection failure (ESP32): Falls back to AP mode

### 6. Testing Checklist
