# Android App Medication Reminder Improvements

## üîß Fixed Issues

### 1. **Reliable Alarm System - Works Even When Device is Locked**

#### Problem
- Alarms were not firing reliably when device was locked
- Notifications were not showing up on lock screen
- Battery optimization was interfering with reminders

#### Solution
**AlarmScheduler.kt Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Switched from `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle()` to `setAlarmClock()` for maximum reliability
- ‚úÖ `setAlarmClock()` bypasses Doze mode and battery optimization
- ‚úÖ Shows alarm icon in status bar
- ‚úÖ Works reliably even when device is in deep sleep
- ‚úÖ Added detailed logging with timestamps for debugging

**MedicationAlarmReceiver.kt Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Added **WakeLock** to ensure processing even when device is sleeping
- ‚úÖ WakeLock timeout set to 60 seconds for safety
- ‚úÖ Proper WakeLock acquisition and release with try-finally
- ‚úÖ Enhanced notification channel with:
  - IMPORTANCE_HIGH priority
  - Alarm sound (instead of notification sound)
  - Bypass Do Not Disturb mode
  - Public visibility on lock screen
- ‚úÖ Full-screen intent for lock screen display
- ‚úÖ Enhanced notification with:
  - MAX priority
  - CATEGORY_ALARM (not REMINDER)
  - Full-screen intent capability
  - Auto-dismiss after 5 minutes
  - Stronger vibration pattern
  - Emoji icons for better visibility

**AndroidManifest.xml Permissions:**
- ‚úÖ Added `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT` permission (Android 10+)

### 3. **Technical Improvements**

#### Alarm Reliability Features:
```kotlin
// Uses setAlarmClock for maximum reliability
if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {
    val alarmClockInfo = AlarmManager.AlarmClockInfo(
        calendar.timeInMillis,
        showIntent
    )
    alarmManager.setAlarmClock(alarmClockInfo, pendingIntent)
}
```

#### WakeLock Implementation:
```kotlin
val wakeLock = powerManager.newWakeLock(
    PowerManager.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK or PowerManager.ACQUIRE_CAUSES_WAKEUP,
    WAKE_LOCK_TAG
).apply {
    acquire(WAKE_LOCK_TIMEOUT)
}

try {
    // Process notification
} finally {
    if (wakeLock.isHeld) {
        wakeLock.release()
    }
}
```

#### Enhanced Notification:
```kotlin
.setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_MAX)
.setCategory(NotificationCompat.CATEGORY_ALARM)
.setFullScreenIntent(pendingIntent, true)
.setSound(RingtoneManager.getDefaultUri(RingtoneManager.TYPE_ALARM))
.setVisibility(NotificationCompat.VISIBILITY_PUBLIC)
```

## üì± User Experience Improvements

1. **Lock Screen Notifications**
   - Notifications now appear on lock screen
   - Can be interacted with without unlocking
   - Full-screen intent shows notification prominently

2. **Reliable Delivery**
   - Works in Doze mode
   - Works with battery optimization enabled
   - Works when app is not running
   - Works when device is locked

3. **Better Visibility**
   - Alarm icon appears in status bar
   - Louder alarm sound (not notification sound)
   - Stronger vibration pattern
   - High priority notification

4. **Modern Design**
   - Consistent with home page
   - Color-coded status
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Professional appearance

## üîÑ Automatic Rescheduling

- Alarms automatically reschedule for next day after firing

- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## ‚úÖ Testing Recommendations

1. **Lock Screen Test:**
   - Lock device
   - Wait for scheduled reminder time
   - Verify notification appears on lock screen

2. **Doze Mode Test:**
   - Put device in airplane mode
   - Lock device for 1+ hour
   - Set reminder for after Doze activates
   - Verify notification still fires

   - Enable battery optimization for app
   - Lock device
   - Verify reminders still fire

4. **UI Test:**
