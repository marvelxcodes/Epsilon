## 🚦 Status: READY FOR TESTING

Everything is implemented and ready to go! This is a complete, working MVP.

## 🔜 Next Steps (After Testing)

Once you've verified the MVP works:

1. **Add Accelerometer/Gyroscope**
   - Connect MPU6050 or similar to ESP32
   - Read sensor data in loop()
   
2. **Implement Fall Detection**
   - Add algorithm to detect sudden acceleration changes
   - Trigger alert condition
   
3. **Send Structured Data**
   - Use JSON format for sensor data
   - Parse on Android side
   
4. **Add Notifications**
   - Android notification on fall detection
   - SMS/call emergency contacts
   
5. **Data Persistence**
   - Store readings in Room database
   - Display history and charts

## 💡 Quick Tips

### For ESP32 Development:
- Use Serial.println() for debugging
- Monitor connection status via Serial Monitor
- Test with ESP32 powered by battery to check real-world usage

### For Android Development:
- Use Logcat for debugging BLE operations
- Test on real device (emulator BLE is limited)
- Check Android version-specific permission handling

### For BLE Communication:
- Keep data packets small (< 20 bytes ideally)
- Use structured format (JSON or binary)
- Handle connection drops gracefully
